    "Once the mass is found (calculate volume, use density), the fuel cost calculator [here](https://www.uxc.com/p/tools/FuelCalculator.aspx) gives the cost of 1 kg, which is used to find the uranium cost in one pebble.  It is assumed that while the number of particles and the enrichment may change, the TRISO particles still use UCO kernels.\n",

    "To find the cost of a single Xe-100 pebble, the cost of the uranium in one pebble is added to the fabrication costs.  Using the specifications for UCO kernel size and the number of TRISO particles per pebble, the volume of UCO, and then the mass using density, can be calculated.\n",

    "The same fuel cost calculator is used to find the cost of 1 kg of 15.5\\%, which is used to find the uranium cost of one pebble.  Added to fabrication costs, we arrive at an estimate of the cost/pebble.  Multiply by the number of pebbles needed for one year, (using fuel needed for one year) and we have cost of fuel per year."
