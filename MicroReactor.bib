	type = {Submittal to {Support} {NRC} {Development} and {Implementation} of {DG}-1353, {A} {Guidance} to {Risk}-{Inform} {Application} {Development} and {Contents} {Including} {Event} {Selection} and {SSC} {Classification}},
	title = {Pilot {Application} for {DG}-1353, {Enclosure} 1},
	abstract = {This application structure is being submitted as a pilot for draft regulatory guide (DG)-1353, “Guidance For A Technology-Inclusive, Risk-Informed, and Performance-Based Approach to Inform the Content of Applications for Licenses, Certifications, and Approvals for Non-Light- Water Reactors.” In public meetings, NRC staff issued a call for designers to pilot the upcoming draft guidance. Oklo is offering this pilot of the guidance as an example for NRC staff in evaluation of the possible benefits, drawbacks, or other impacts of a proposed guidance. The goal is not to show the impacts of the guidance in a final form, but for illustrative purposes in a possible application structure how the guidance may be used for a particular design, and further how the implications of its use might affect a submittal to the NRC on a relatively holistic basis. Although the Draft Guidance intends to reference a future NEI report, for the purposes of the preparation of this report, the Licensing Modernization Project report “Risk- Informed Performance-Based Guidance for Non-Light Water Reactor Licensing Basis Development,” Revision L, issued May 25, 2018 was used.
The DG-1353 provides an alternative means for performing the necessary tasks of analyzing licensing basis events and for assessing safety-relation of structures, systems, and components (SSCs) as well as defense-in-depth. The guidance is part of a broader transformation of the NRC to more effectively regulate potential new technologies, which is described in SECY-18- 0060, “Achieving Modern Risk-Informed Regulation,” and other documents.
Of particular concern to NRC staff is ensuring that the level of detail submitted and reviewed in regulatory review is appropriate to that required to make decisions, especially safety decisions on the design in question. Excessive detail would slow review, and utilize unnecessary federal resources, while too little detail would have the same effect, due to the need for the NRC to ask questions on detail not provided but needed to reach a decision.
It is expected that the proposed guidance could provide a framework for both applicants and the NRC to have more regulatory certainty on level of detail required for applications. The DG- 1353 framework provides a baseline for what SSCs are safety-related or important to safety, and therefore a relative basis for application content as far as level of information necessary and appropriate for topics required by regulation to be addressed in an application. This pilot submittal in particular may provide one perspective on how analysis of licensing basis events, safety-relation and importance to safety of structures, systems, and components, and resulting evidence of defense-in-depth may affect level of detail to meet existing regulatory requirements in a possible application. The structure of this pilot submittal was developed directly from regulatory requirements for application structure. These requirements are outlined in Title 10 to the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR) sections as appropriate for different approval, certification, permits, or licensing pathways. For example, for a standard design certification, rules for contents of applications are specified in 10 CFR 52.46 and 52.47. For a standard design approval, rules for contents of applications is given in 10 CFR 52.136 and 10 CFR 52.137. For a combined license (COL) application, rules for contents of applications are given in 10 CFR 52.77, 52.79, and 52.80. In the interest of holistic application of the concepts covered in the DG- 1353, the requirements for a COL application were followed.},

	abstract = {In this work, the development and technologies of micro heat pipe cooled reactor are overviewed. The micro heat pipe cooled reactor, mainly consists of a reactor core, energy conversion system, shielding and heat removal system, is a new type reactor using heat pipes to cool the core. It is a potential candidate for the electricity supplying in decentralized electricity market. With the adoption of heat pipe, monolithic core and high efficient energy conversion system, this reactor is greatly simplified by omitting the main pipeline, circulating pump and auxiliary equipments, which results in a low cost and compact system. The monolithic reactor design is highly evolved in neutronics and thermal hydraulics. Compared with the commercial nuclear power plant, these micro reactors are factory manufacturable and transportable, thus the launch or transportation accident safety should be guaranteed. Until now, this kind of reactor design of kilowatt level is more mature than that of megawatt level. The difficulties and challenges need to be overcome in the future are summarized, including heat pipe cascading failure, fuel enrichment, structure integrity, machining, monolithic thermal stress, inspection and qualification, etc.},

	abstract = {The demand for more practical and innovative nuclear reactor designs capable of providing clean energy to meet new global demands is revolutionizing the nuclear industry. In this paper we present the fuel cycle and neutronics analysis of a design expected to be similar to the Westinghouse eVinci™ heat pipe (HP) reactor. The concept considered here uses low enriched urania rods and potassium liquid metal-cooled HPs to remove heat from the core. The fuel and HPs are contained in steel monolith to form the core which is surrounded by an alumina reflector. There is no need for forced circulation to remove heat from the active core region, thus eliminating the use of pumps, valves and tube piping. The concept is designed to operate safely and provide a reliable autonomous power supply in support of off-grid missions. This study shows that the HP reactor design can operate for more than 10 years without refueling. Further, we show that the current design of the HP reactor concept is best suited to serve as a nuclear battery rather than a centralized power source. We also studied the nuclear fuel cycle performance of the HP reactor concept in a once-through fuel cycle. The natural resource utilization, waste output, and environmental impact, as defined in a reference study from the literature, did not perform as well on a GWe per year energy basis compared to light water reactors with less than 5\% enriched uranium in a once-through fuel cycle. Parasitic absorption in the steel monolith structure and neutron leakage lower the reactivity of the core, which decreases the discharge burnup of the fuel. Analysis of modifications of the monolith material and size of the reference core configuration showed that the neutron leakage impact on the small sized HP core is the most limiting factor on the fuel cycle performance.},

incrementally to closely match increasing energy demand resulting in a moderate financial commitment for
countries or regions with smaller electricity grids. SMRs show the promise of significant cost reduction
through modularization and factory construction which should further improve the construction schedule and
reduce costs. In the area of wider applicability SMR designs and sizes are better suited for partial or
dedicated use in non-electrical applications such as providing heat for industrial processes, hydrogen
production or sea-water desalination. Process heat or cogeneration results in significantly improved thermal
efficiencies leading to a better return on investment. Some SMR designs may also serve niche markets, for
example to burn nuclear waste.
Booklets on the status of SMR technology developments have been published in 2012, 2014 and 2016. The
objective is to provide Member States with a concise overview of the latest status of SMR designs. This
booklet is reporting the advances in design and technology developments of SMRs of all the major
technology lines within the category of SMRs. It covers land based and marine based water-cooled reactors,
high temperature gas cooled reactors, liquid metal, sodium and gas-cooled fast neutron spectrum reactors and
molten salt reactors. The content on the specific SMRs is provided by the responsible institute or

	abstract = {An important niche for nuclear energy is the need for power at remote locations
removed from a reliable electrical grid. Nuclear energy has potential applications at
strategic defense locations, theaters of battle, remote communities, and emergency
locations. With proper safeguards, a 1 to 10-MWe (megawatt electric) mobile reactor
system could provide robust, self-contained, and long-term power in any environment.
Heat pipe-cooled fast-spectrum nuclear reactors have been identified as a candidate
for these applications. Heat pipe reactors, using alkali metal heat pipes, are perfectly
suited for mobile applications because their nature is inherently simpler, smaller, and
more reliable than “traditional” reactors.
The goal of this project was to develop a scalable conceptual design for a compact
reactor and to identify scaling issues for compact heat pipe cooled reactors in general.
Toward this goal two detailed concepts were developed, the first concept with more
conventional materials and a power of about 2 MWe and a the second concept with
less conventional materials and a power level of about 5 MWe. A series of more
qualitative advanced designs were developed (with less detail) that show power levels
can be pushed to approximately 30 MWe.},
