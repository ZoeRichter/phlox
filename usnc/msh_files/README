Python scripts:
---------------
* geometry_extrude2.py: produces a geometry (.geo) based on the placement of circles and then it extrudes them to generate a 3D geometry. This is the one that works. The extension of this script is 'moltres_geometry.py'.
* moltres_geometry.py: produces a the 3D geometry of the MMR. It is based on the script 'geometry_extrude2.py'.

* get_arc_upper.py: produces arcs instead of circles if they intersect the upper line (90 degrees)
* get_arc_lower.py: produces arcs instead of circles if they intersect the lower line (angle a1)
* get_arc.py: produces arcs instead of circles if they intersect any of the lines. It doesn't contemplate the case where the circle intersects both lines.
*extend_arc.py: extends get_arc for a simple reactor geometry. Meant to apply get_arc to geometry3D_extrude2.py


.geo & .msh files:
------------------
* 2fuel2.geo: produced by "geometry_extrude2.py". It defines 2 fuel channels and the moderator.
* 4fuel.geo: produced by "geometry_extrude2.py". It defines 4 fuel channels and the moderator.

* cut1.geo: simple geometry that defines a single fuel channel and the moderator. The moderator has the shape of slice of pizza. The fuel channel is completely defined in the geometry.
