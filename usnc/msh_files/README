.geo & .msh files:
------------------
* MMR3D_full: has 3D geometry of the full core of the MMR.
* MMR3D_cut30: has 3D geometry of the MMR with 1/12th (30 degrees) of the reactor.
* unit_cell: elementary cell with 1/12th of the fuel channel and 1/12th of the coolant channel.

Python scripts:
---------------
* full_core.py: Produces MMR3D_full.geo
* extend_arc2D.py: Produces 2D geometry of 1/12th (30 degress) of the reactor.
Then the geometry has to be extruded and add the physical groups by hand to produce the 3D geometry.
* fuel_assembly2D.py: Produces 2D geometry of one fuel assembly.
