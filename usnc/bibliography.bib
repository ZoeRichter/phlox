	abstract = {Small Modular Reactor of few mega watts range meets power need at remote area when it can be 'factory manufactured' and extremely safe. We have developed a concept of Micro Modular Reactor based on the FCM compact fuel which has superior safety characteristics. We have made a preliminary neutronic analysis to confirm the long life time which is essential for remote application, and to check the controllability based on the criticality analysis. A core of 200 cm diameter and 200 cm or 300 cm long cylinder shape can achieve the core life of 5 ∼ 10 years with 20 ∼ 10\% LEU. When the rated power is reduced by design, the service period can be extended to 20 ∼ 40 years. (author)},
