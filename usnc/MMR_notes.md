*Core Description: This description of the core can be found in the '14-6782 NEUP Final Report' about this reactor. In this descption the reactor core has a height of 63.25 cm. Other sources indicate that the core height should be around 300 cm for a 12% enrichment of the fuel ('Preliminary Core Analysis of a Micro Modular Reactor'). Also the core description found in this document uses pellets of 0.9cm-radius, hile other sources indicate that the radius of the pellets goes from 0.4 to 0.7 cm. The fuel channel radius in the report is 2.17 cm, and the cooling channel radius is 1.55 cm.
