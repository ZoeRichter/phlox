M.B. Richards "Reaction of nuclear-grade graphite
 with low concentrations of steam in the helium coolant of an MHTGR"
 mentions that H-451 graphite is used for the modular HGTR
reactor

density: 1.74 Mg/m^3

PROPERTIES OF UNIRRADIATED FUEL ELEMENT GRAPHITES H-451 AND TS-1240 has
a table on impurities.  Matters iff in significant ppm and has a significant
cross section.  ((add later and see if matters))
