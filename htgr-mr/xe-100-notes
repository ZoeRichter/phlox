M.B. Richards "Reaction of nuclear-grade graphite
 with low concentrations of steam in the helium coolant of an MHTGR"
 mentions that H-451 graphite is used for the modular HGTR
reactor

density: 1.74 Mg/m^3

PROPERTIES OF UNIRRADIATED FUEL ELEMENT GRAPHITES H-451 AND TS-1240 has
a table on impurities.  Matters iff in significant ppm and has a significant
cross section.  ((add later and see if matters))

current notes on full core model:

when I dropped the U235 enrichment down to 0.03xxxxx, I ended up with a k-eff of ~1.08, which seems much better.
*convert this 0.03 mass percent isotopic concentration for UCO as a whole to just uranium enrichment, see what that
comes out with.  Maybe the enrichment really is closer to LWR enrichments?*

I updated the temperature to the closest to 777K (the average of the inlet and outlet temperatures) that the xs
data had available.  As I would expect, k increased when temperature decreased, as reactors are designed to have
negative temp coeffs.
    since this is a sign that modeling the temperature with a better resolution wouldn't solve the current k problem, I
    will put that on the back burner for now.
